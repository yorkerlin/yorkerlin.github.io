In this series of blog posts, I will cover the basics of Information Geometry. There will be 4 blogs to cover this basic.
The first blog is about motivation and statistical manifolds.
The second blog is about the Fisher-Rao metric and Riemannian/natural gradients.
The third blog is about natural-gradient descent (NGD) and Riemannian-gradient descent.
The last blog is about natural-gradient descent and mirror descent for exponential family distributions.
