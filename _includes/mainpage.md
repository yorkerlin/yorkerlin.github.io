# About Me

Postdoctoral fellow working on computational aspects of differential, geometric, and algebraic structures (i.e., probability distributions and matrices). My research so far has mostly focused on geometric methods for **numerical optimization** and **approximate inference** in machine learning.

## Research Interests

I am interested in exploiting (hidden) structures and symmetries in machine learning with a focus on practical and numerical methods for optimization and statistical inference.
