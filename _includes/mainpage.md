# About Me

PhD student working on computational aspects of differential, geometric, and algebraic structures. My research so far has mostly focused on geometric methods for machine learninng such as
* approximate inference using information geometry structures
* numerical optimization using manifold structures and Lie groups

For generalized natural-gradient methods, please see 
* Structured natural-gradient descent: [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEY1ZxDJX8o&t=11s), [ICML Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07405), [Blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-07-05-GeomProj01 %})

For more publications, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sGl6muoAAAAJ&hl=en) page.

I review papers from conferences ([ICML](https://icml.cc/), [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/), [AI&Stats](https://aistats.org/)), journals ([JMLR](https://www.jmlr.org/), [Information Geometry (Springer)](https://www.springer.com/journal/41884)), and workshops ([Optimization for Machine Learning](https://opt-ml.org/), [Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference](http://approximateinference.org/)).

## Research Interests

I am interested in exploiting (hidden) structures and symmetries in machine learning with a focus on practical and numerical methods for optimization and statistical inference.
