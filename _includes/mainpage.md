## About Me

PhD student working on computational aspects of *differential structures* such as geometric and algebraic structures. My research so far has mostly focused on *information geometry* and *manifold optimization*.

For generalized natural-gradient methods, please see 
* Structured natural gradient descent: [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEY1ZxDJX8o&t=11s), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07405)
* Riemannian gradient descent: [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu1hT-LExFg), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10060)

For publications, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sGl6muoAAAAJ&hl=en).

I review papers from conferences (ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AI&Stats) and journals (JMLR, Information Geometry (Springer)).  

## Research Interests

I am interested in exploiting (hidden) structures and symmetries in machine learning with a focus on practical and numerical methods for optimization and posterior inference.
