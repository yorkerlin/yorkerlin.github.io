# About Me

PhD student working on computational aspects of differential, geometric, and algebraic structures (i.e., statistical distributions/manifolds and matrices/Lie-groups). My research so far has mostly focused on geometric methods for **approximate inference** and  **numerical optimization** in machine learning

For generalized natural-gradient methods, please see

I review papers from conferences ([ICML](https://icml.cc/), [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/), [AI&Stats](https://aistats.org/)), journals ([JMLR](https://www.jmlr.org/), [Information Geometry (Springer)](https://www.springer.com/journal/41884)), and workshops ([Optimization for Machine Learning](https://opt-ml.org/), [Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference](http://approximateinference.org/)).

## Research Interests

I am interested in exploiting (hidden) structures and symmetries in machine learning with a focus on practical and numerical methods for optimization and statistical inference.
