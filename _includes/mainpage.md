## About Me

PhD student working on computational *differential structures* such as geometric and algebraic structures. My research so far has mostly focused on *information geometry* and *manifold optimization*.

For talks, see my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkzT14GKLJC1EDjV-OzQffA).

For publications, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sGl6muoAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Research Interests

I am interested in exploiting (hidden) structures and symmetries in machine learning with a focus on practical and efficient methods for optimization and posterior inference.
