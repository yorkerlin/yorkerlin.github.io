## About Me

PhD student working on computational *differential structures* such as geometric and algebraic structures. My research so far has mostly focused on *information geometry* and *manifold optimization*.


For more details, see  my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sGl6muoAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Research Interests

I am interested in *geometric* methods in machine learning, including the development of optimization algorihms as well as design of approximate inference methods.
